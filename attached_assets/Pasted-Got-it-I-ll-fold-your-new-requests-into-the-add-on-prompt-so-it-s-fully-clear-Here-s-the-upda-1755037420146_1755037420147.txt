Got it — I’ll fold your new requests into the **add-on prompt** so it’s fully clear.
Here’s the updated version with:

* **Research to unlock a “Stats” tab** in Stage 1
* The **next stage after GUI** included in the roadmap

---

## **Ghostwriter Prompt Add-Ons for Button Tycoon**

*(Integrate into the existing Button Tycoon project prompt)*

---

### **1. Terminal & Commands**

* **Scrollable Terminal:** If text overflows, make terminal output scrollable instead of cutting it off.
* **Help Command Filtering:**

  * Show only commands that are currently usable based on the player’s state.
  * Example: If “Project GUI” research is incomplete, `transition gui` should not be shown in `help`.
* **Goal:** Add a first-time player goal: *“Type `help` in the terminal”*.
* **Debug Commands:** Keep `reset()` and `addMoney <amount>` commands available for testing, but do not show them in `help`.

---

### **2. Research Tab & Display Rules**

* **Fixed Position Container:** The research list container must not overlap the terminal — keep it fixed.
* Make the container scrollable if it exceeds available vertical space.
* **Hide Unavailable Research:** Do not display research projects that can’t be started yet (no “greyed out” items).
* **ASCII Art Schematics Bug:** Fix mismatch between displayed research duration and actual duration.
* **Research Completion Feedback:** When a research finishes, display a clear completion message in the terminal.
* **New Research — Stats Tab:**

  * Add a research project that unlocks a “Stats” tab in the UI.
  * Stats tab displays total money earned, total upgrades purchased, research completed, time played, etc.
  * Make it accessible only after certain prerequisites (e.g., having hired at least one intern).

---

### **3. Upgrades & Economy**

* **Earlier Passive Income:** Introduce a cheap early upgrade for passive money generation in Stage 1.
* **Slower Price Growth:** Adjust scaling so early and mid-game prices rise more gradually.
* **More Upgrades:** Add upgrades for:

  * Increasing income per `assemble`
  * Boosting script output
  * Improving intern productivity
  * Enhancing tooling efficiency
* Keep pacing similar to **Cookie Clicker** for engagement.

---

### **4. Stage Progression**

* **Stage 1 → Stage 2 (Terminal → GUI)**

  * Capstone research: “Project GUI” (WIMP Interface Development).
  * Transition requires typing `transition gui` in the terminal with confirmation prompt.
  * Resets money, upgrades, and buildings.
  * Stage 2 features “Press Button” mechanic and mouse-related upgrades.
  * Include Konami code Easter egg for debug in Stage 2.

* **Stage 2 → Stage 3 (Internet Era)**

  * Capstone research: “Global Networking Initiative”.
  * Transition similar to Stage 1 → 2 (confirmation + full reset).
  * New focus: websites, online services, traffic-based income.
  * Introduce upgrades for bandwidth, hosting, and SEO.
  * Add research projects for automation, online advertising, and “Web 2.0” features.

---

### **5. Integration Notes**

* Fully integrate with the existing React + Vite component structure.
* Keep state updates immutable.
* Maintain component-based architecture with separate files for UI, data, and logic.

If you want, I can now **merge this add-on list with the earlier “super prompt”** so you have **one single master prompt** that covers *everything* from Stage 1 to Stage 3 with all upgrades, research, and bug fixes.
That way, you just paste it into Replit Ghostwriter and get the complete multi-file game in one go.

Do you want me to do that merge now?
